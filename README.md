This project was done as part of a coding challenge for Showwcase.

## use yarn start to run the project
it consists of 2 screens - Home and Dashboard. follows the given mockup

please note that I can add additional features like toast notification for education entry validation, persisting data for each user using Local Storage (since there is no api/server), form validation (end date should be greater than start date) etc. if required.

This is my first time using TypeScript, Styled Components and Styled System. Even though this was not mandatory, I wanted to learn and explore this stack.
I have also used Antd for entering start and end dates for an education in the modal view.
